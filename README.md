# CS 286 NLP Project üöÄ

Welcome to our CS 286 NLP Project, an adventurous dive into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, we're experimenting with the following cutting-edge models: Roberta, LSTM, and DeBERTa. If these sound intimidating, fear not! We'll guide you throughout the journey.

Our trained models can be accessed directly via this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSEQRCJJ5Kb-oih_o9CjJGHSbM0ku9ra?usp=sharing).

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory Structure

- `nlp_api.ipynb`: This is our main API notebook which handles data requests from the frontend.
- `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: This is where we carry out a detailed analysis of our dataset through various visualizations.
- `roberta_train.ipynb`, `lstm_train.ipynb`, `deberta_train.ipynb`: These notebooks are used to train respective models with our dataset and save the trained models for future use.
- `frontend`: This directory hosts our ReactJS-based frontend code.

## üéâ Getting Started 

_(Please note that Steps 1-4 and Step 11 are optional, but they provide a smoother experience!)_

1. Install NodeJS (version 14.18.0).
2. Navigate to the frontend directory via your terminal.
3. Execute the command: `npm install`.
4. Follow it up with: `npm run build`.
5. Visit our Google Drive via this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSEQRCJJ5Kb-oih_o9CjJGHSbM0ku9ra?usp=sharing).
6. Add a shortcut of this shared folder to your Google Drive for easy access.
7. Open `nlp_api.pynb` in Google Colab.
8. Mount your Google Drive in the Colab environment.
9. Take note of the path to the shortcut folder you created in Step 6 within Google Colab.
10. Replace "BASE_PATH" in `nlp_api.pynb` with the path from Step 9.
11. Optionally, you can upload all the contents from the `/frontend/build` directory to the Google Drive's `/nlp_capstone/frontend` directory.
12. Run all the cells in `nlp_api.pynb`.
13. Finally, open the generated link in a browser to admire your handiwork!

Enjoy the journey through our project, and we hope it provides a valuable experience!
