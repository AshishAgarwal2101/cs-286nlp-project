It will prepare the child for the harmonious transformation from a student into a responsible citizen. Thus, in order to make a better life for the children, education is mandatory for everyone. Therefore, the government should make education free for everyone. There are also some negative results if the education in colleges and universities is made free. There are some students, after completing their Higher Secondary, who opt for a professional course or vocational course. These students are aware of their aptitudes and have grown up. Some of them are interested in business, others opt for general courses. If education is made free in colleges and universities, then more students will be interested in taking up general courses. This can further result in unemployment, as there will be fewer job opportunities for the huge number of qualified students. The government can tackle this strong competition by adopting different methods of admitting the student. One of the methods is Entrance- Exams, where the students will be allowed to enter on the basis of their merit. The shortage in the job opportunity will lead the educated and highly qualified to settle down in low-level jobs, where they do not get their deserved honour for their capability and hard work. Thus the people will get demoralised and would get diverted from the idea of getting higher education. This would further put the image of free university education down in the eyes of new aspirants.\"\n",

The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!\\r\\n\\r\\nSome students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nsome student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nso principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!\\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely, STUDENT_NAME\""

It will prepare the child for the harmonious transformation from a student into a responsible citizen. Thus, in order to make a better life for the children, education is mandatory for everyone. Therefore, the government should make education free for everyone. There are also some negative results if the education in colleges and universities is made free. There are some students, after completing their Higher Secondary, who opt for a professional course or vocational course. These students are aware of their aptitudes and have grown up. Some of them are interested in business, others opt for general courses. If education is made free in colleges and universities, then more students will be interested in taking up general courses. This can further result in unemployment, as there will be fewer job opportunities for the huge number of qualified students. The government can tackle this strong competition by adopting different methods of admitting the student. One of the methods is Entrance- Exams, where the students will be allowed to enter on the basis of their merit. The shortage in the job opportunity will lead the educated and highly qualified to settle down in low-level jobs, where they do not get their deserved honour for their capability and hard work. Thus the people will get demoralised and would get diverted from the idea of getting higher education. This would further put the image of free university education down in the eyes of new aspirants.\""
